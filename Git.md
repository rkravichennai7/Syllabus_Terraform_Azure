ðŸ“˜ Git Teaching Syllabus
1. Introduction to Git & Version Control

What is Version Control (VCS) & why Git?

Git vs centralized systems (SVN, TFS)

Installing Git & configuring (username, email, editor, aliases)

Understanding local, remote, and distributed repositories

2. Git Basics

Creating repositories (git init, git clone)

File lifecycle: untracked â†’ staged â†’ committed

Core commands: git add, git commit, git status, git log

Viewing history and diffs (git log, git diff)

3. Branching & Merging

What is a branch? Why branching strategies matter

Creating & switching branches (git branch, git checkout, git switch)

Merging branches (git merge)

Fast-forward vs recursive merge

Handling merge conflicts

4. Working with Remote Repositories

Connecting to remotes (git remote add, git remote -v)

git fetch, git pull, git push

Forks, origin vs upstream

Best practices for collaboration

5. Rewriting History & Undoing Changes

git reset (soft, mixed, hard)

git checkout & git restore

git revert vs git reset

Amending commits (git commit --amend)

Dropping commits safely

6. Advanced Git Concepts

Stashing work (git stash)

Cherry-picking commits (git cherry-pick)

Rebasing (git rebase, git rebase -i)

Squash commits

Git tags (lightweight vs annotated)

7. Collaboration & Workflows

GitFlow workflow

Trunk-based development

Feature branch workflow

Pull requests & code reviews (GitHub, GitLab, Azure Repos)

Protected branches & policies

8. Git Internals (for deeper understanding)

How Git stores data (commits, blobs, trees, refs)

.git folder structure

SHA-1 hashes & content-addressable storage

HEAD, refs, and detached HEAD

9. Git Tools & Ecosystem

Git GUI clients (GitKraken, Sourcetree, GitHub Desktop)

Git hooks (pre-commit, post-commit, etc.)

Submodules & Monorepos

Large File Storage (Git LFS)

CI/CD integration with Git

10. Hands-On Projects & Case Studies

Setting up a collaborative repo with branching strategy

Code reviews with pull requests

Resolving a real merge conflict

Rebasing & squashing before merging

Creating tags & releases for a project
